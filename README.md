# Webmaps-
Created with python and folium while learning new things in python.
Used many functions of the folium library but also used pandas for the data sets. 

It includes a map of the world, and on the map countries are colored different regarding the country population. 
green <10.000.000 
yellow between 10.000.000 and 20.000.000
red >20.000.000
If you take a look at the US, you will see different colored circles regarding their height.
On the top right we have a menu regarding the layers of the map.
